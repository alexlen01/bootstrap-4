## Installation and Usage

The recommended installation method is a local NPM install for your project:

```bash
$ npm install lite-server --save-dev
```

...and add a "script" entry within your project's `package.json` file:

```json
# Inside package.json...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "lite-server"
  },
```
